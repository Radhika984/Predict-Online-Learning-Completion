# Predict-Online-Learning-Completion
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will complete an online course using machine learning techniques. The aim is to help improve student retention by identifying learners at risk of dropping out.

📌 Objective
To build a predictive model that uses student activity, performance, and demographic data to forecast course completion.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
